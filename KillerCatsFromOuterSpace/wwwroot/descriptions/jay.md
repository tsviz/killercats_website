# Jay - Drums

Jay is known for being a passionate and expressive drummer who draws inspiration from some of the most important and influential drummers in music. His style incorporates the complex rhythms, odd time signatures, and dynamic sound of *Danny Carey (Tool)*, combined with the quick rolls, fills, and powerful patterns inspired by *Abe Cunningham (Deftones)*. 

Along with those, he looks up to incredible drummers like *Larnell Lewis*, *Billy Cobham*, and *Sean Kinney*, all of whom have shaped his unique approach to drumming.

As the drummer for **Killer Cats From Outer Space**, Jay brings these influences together to create a unique sound he can call his own. He is constantly learning new styles to introduce variety to the songs they play together as a band.

Currently, Jay is pursuing a music degree to deepen his understanding of composition and songwriting, aiming to contribute to well-rounded songs for their band. He is just one moving part that makes this band work well, and he is incredibly grateful for the talent his amazing bandmates bring to every performance.
